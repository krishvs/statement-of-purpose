My primary interest lies in the design and implementation of software systems in the field of web-technologies.
I am currently working as a web-developer as part of a team in-charge of dev-ops and performance tuning for one of the top 2000 most used websites in the world.
While I have greatly enjoyed working as a developer, I feel that it is essential that I combine my background in computer development with further education in the management of technology.
This has attracted me to the Ms MIS programme offered by cmu which would not only help in my short term career goal of learning technology management but also my long term goal of creating and developing my own product/startup. 

My first computer - A windows 1998 was a gift for my 8th birthday.
While I didn't get into programming until much later I greatly enjoyed playing "asteroids" among other games on it.
My first programming assignment was in the 12th grade,a computer science project had to be submitted to graduate high school.
I took this oppurtunity to re-create "asteroids" in c++.
I greatly enjoyed both the logical complexities as well as the satisfaction that programming offered,and was awarded top marks.This experience convinced me to take up my undergraduation in the field of computer science.
