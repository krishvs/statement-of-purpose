For the past year and half I have been working as a developer at a startup that has grown from obscurity to become the largest online helpdesk software firm in india during the period.
As an early stage employee of the firm,I have witnessed first hand the importance of technology management and design in developing a world class product.
I would like to learn these skills so that I can manage my own product in the future.

My first computer - A windows 1995 was a gift for my 6th birthday.
While I didn't get into programming until much later I greatly enjoyed playing "asteroids" among other games on it.
Having studied in several countries during my schooling days the computer provided me with the platform to make friends from a variety of cultures based on a common love for computer games. // sentence is too long - remove?
My first programming assignment was in the 12th grade,the central board of education had a compulsory computer science project to be submitted to graduate high school.
I took this oppurtunity to re-create "asteroids" in c++.
I greatly enjoyed both the logical complexity well as the satisfaction that programming offered,and was awarded top mark.This experience convinced me to take up my undergraduation in the field of computer science.

I decided to enroll at SSN college - one of the best college in india run by HCL(a fortune 500 software company).

During my first year I had courses on programming that taught me c++ and basic web-development.
My curiosity piqued, I applied for an internship at 7stl - a startup in Chennai.
The company offered me an opportunity to intern at their singapore campus.
It was my first international intern experience and I was exposed to a variety of technologies like redis , jsf etc.
During the internship I worked on an human capital management module of a larger erp system for Qatar airways.
The time and resource constrained nature of the project made me appreciate the importance of project management.

During my second year of undergraduation I starting actively participating in several programming clubs at college.
My intership helped me with learning java and I decided to take the oracle certification for java which I passed with flying colors.
I started participating in a number of national level technical symposiums as well and won several programming and quiz events.
Recognising my passion I was choosen to represent the college at the prestigious ACM-ICPC indian finals conducted by IBM.
Our team placed 58th out of 300 colleges which had qualified for the finals.
Based on my performance in college I was elected as the secretary of the student chapter of ACM

Participating and winning tech symposiums got me my second internship.
The symposium at ceg,anna university was sponsered by Dell Force10Networks and I was offered an internship at their R&D center in chennai after winning 7 out of 8 programming events.
I worked on the snpm manager of their routers writing a balancer in python.
It was my first experience interning at a R&D center and I was able to learn first hand how large scale data centers are set up and managed. 
The internship also to introduced me to the concepts of distributed programming.

My internship experiences along with my graduation courses piqued my interest in cloud computing and I started working on a javascript framework that could be programmed once and deployed everywhere - the cloud,desktop or mobile.
I decided to undertake my undergraduation thesis on the same project under Prof balasubramaniam.
To test the feasablity of the project under real world settings our thesis team re-wrote our colleges internal examination tools using our framework.
It was a sucess and our thesis was chosen to be displayed at the AICTE sponsed industry conference where we were to judged by industry experts from a variety of fortune 500 companies like CTS and HCL.
Our project was awarded the best undergraduation thesis in the conference.

After graduation I joined Zoho - considered by many to be india's most successfull IT product company as a software developer.
I was part of the team responsible for storage and analysis of the millions of the documents created daily by the companies customers.
As a team of 9 ot was a great learning experience where I experienced first hand developing and managing software at such a large scale.

It was 2 months into this job that I met my current employeer at a technology conference.
A former employee of Zoho, he had left to start a software helpdesk startup called Freshdesk.
After a brief 5 minute talk over coffee he suprised me by inviting me to come work with him.
I decided to take the risk and joined the startup.
3 months into the job based on my performance I was shifted to the operations and performance team and was directly reporting to the CTO for all technology related issues.
It was my first promotion and with it I was also one of the very few employees offered stock options.
During my stay at freshdesk the company has raised more than 56 million dollars and is the only company to be funded by google capital in india.
Being responsible for all of freshdesk's soft real time systems written in nodejs and erlang has been a very challenging experience.
The company's product has grown from recieving 10 or 15 req/second to 25000 req/second.
Scaling at this rate and operating at this scale has been a great learning experience.

Along with my job I am also an avid traveller.Having travelled to 18 countries, I started venturing into adventure sports while working.
In the past one year I have trekked in the himalayas in bhutan, skuba dived in singapore and explored the country side of cambodia.
My passion for travelling made me create tripplanner.io - a travel plannig and blogging platform,and is currently used by a niche group of travellers.

Along with a group of friends, I created Rajnilang - a programming language based on the film dialogues of famous indian filmstar Rajnikanth to teach programming to children.
We launched the project at a technology event conducted by paypal.
We recieved wide press coverage praising the innovative initiative with personal interviews in several national newspapers like The econic times,Hindu etc.
The initiative led to being invited to ycombinators first startup school to be held outside of USA in london.

My background in computer science developed and the experiences that I have had in my career uptill now has convinced me that technology management is a vital skill that needs to be learned to create any sucessfull product.
I feel that the ms in mis at cmu is perfectly alligned with both by short term goal of getting into project management and my long term goal of setting up my own startup.






One of these symposiums was sponsered by dell and I was invited to do an internship at their r and d division in chennai after being placed second overall in the symposium.
I worked on an snmp manager for their virtual routers during the internship.

During my second year of undergraduation I started participating in several national level tech symposiums where I won several programming and quiz events in prestigious universities.Based on my onvolvement and interest in computer science I was elected as the secretary of The ACM student chapter at my college during their third year of undergraduation.Representing the college in the indian acm-icpc finals conducted by IBM at amrita university exposed me to the top developers from across the country.Participating in these symposiums also led me to my first internship at an researh and development facility.
