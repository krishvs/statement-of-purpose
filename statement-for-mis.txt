My primary interest lies in the design and implementation of software systems in the field of web-technologies.I am currently working as a web-developer as part of a team incharge of dev-ops and performance tuning for one of the top 2000 most used websites in the world.While I have greatly enjoyed working as a developer, I feel that it is essential that I combine my knowledge of computer development with management of technology.This has attracted me to the Ms MIS prgramme offered by cmu which would not only help in my short term career goal of learning technology management but also my long term goal of creating and developing my own product.

My first computer - A windows 1998 was given as a gift for my 8th birthday.While I didn't get into programming until much later I greatly enjoyed playing "asteroids" among other games on it.Having studied in several countries during my schooling days the computer provided me with the platform to make friends with students from a variety of cultures based on a common love for computer games.I first started to programme in my 12th grade.The central board of education had a compulsory computer science project to be submitted to graduate high school.I took this oppurtunity to re-create "asteroids" in c++.I greatly enjoyed both the logical complexity well as the satisfaction that programming offered, and was awarded top mark.This experience convinced me to take up my undergraduation in the field of computer science.

I decided to enroll at SSN college - one of the best college in india run by HCL( a fortune 500 IT company).It was during my first year that I was exposed to the world of web development.I was extremely fascinated and applied for a part time job at a tech company and was offered a job as a web developer after college hours in the evening.It was here that I was first exposed to the intracies and challenges of product development.Based my performance the company offered me the oppurtunity to intern at their campus in Singapore.Working on a time contrained project for a fortune 500 client in an international setting was a eye opener and further fueled my passion.Having programmed using java during the iternship I decided to take the oracle java certification exam which I passed with flying colors.Java instilled in me a passion for opensource software and I started actively participitating in several opensource clubs at college.
During my second year of undergraduation I started participating in several national level tech symposiums where I won several programming and quiz events in prestigious universities.Based on my onvolvement and interest in computer science I was elected as the secretary of The ACM student chapter at my college during their third year of undergraduation.Representing the college in the indian acm-icpc finals conducted by IBM at amrita university exposed me to the top developers from across the country.Participating in these symposiums also led me to my first internship at an researh and development facility.
